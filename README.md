Project Overview

This project estimates the probability of getting different “hands” in a poker game. It simulates drawing 5 random cards repeatedly (1,000 times by default) and counts the number of times each poker hand occurs. A graphical display shows a sample of each hand and calculated probability is output with SFML.
